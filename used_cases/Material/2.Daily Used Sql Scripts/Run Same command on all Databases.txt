If you want to execute same command in all the databases you can use below query.. 
Note: Edit the query in EXEC() brackets. No need to change anything.

DECLARE @command varchar(1000) 
SELECT @command = 'IF ''?'' NOT IN(''master'', ''model'', ''msdb'', ''tempdb'') BEGIN USE ? 
   EXEC('' grant showplan to Test'') END' 
EXEC sp_MSforeachdb @command
