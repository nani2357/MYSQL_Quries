while removing replcation if we are getting error like distributor database is participating in replication and can not be removed.
in such case make the distributor database offline and drop db

Error
An error occurred while processing the log for database 'iboxxStaticData_Bloomberg'.  If possible, restore from backup. If a backup is not available, it might be necessary to rebuild the log. (Source: MSSQLServer, Error number: 9004)
Get help: http://help/9004

since it is qa server, i have restarted the log reader job and distributr job.

and check for any sessions running for this db , if it occupying the log space, then kill it and shrink the log file.

and for missing stored proc errors,  we need to script out those stored proc from publisher and excute it on subscriber.
