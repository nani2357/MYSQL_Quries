SQL Server 2005 adds additional shrink logic to compress TEXT/IMAGE data, referred to as LOBs.     The dbcc shrink* code uses the same underlying methods that ALTER INDEX .... WITH (LOB_COMPACTION ON) uses to compact the LOB space in the database files.   

There are various stages of dbcc shrink* activity.   These stages are indicated in the sys.dm_exec_requests command column along with the progress indications. 


1 DbccSpaceReclaim 

 Clean up deferred allocations and purge empty extents preparing for data moves.   
 
2 DbccFilesCompact 
 Moves pages beyond the target to before the target and truncate file as required. 
 
3 DbccLOBCompact 
 Compacting the LOB data.
