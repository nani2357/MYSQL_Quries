Databases
Total no. of databses in sql server 5+32762=32767
System databases
user defined databases
System Databases
5 System Databases
Master
Model
MsDB
TempDB
Resource Database

Master Database
Contains all the system objects like how many tables, colums all meta data
One of the core database to manage sql server
Instance level configuration
It will know about all the databases in the sql server
files for each database
Logins
Linked /Remote servers
End points
If there is no master database we can not start sql server

Model Database
Model Database will act as a template for newly created database
Everything including data and tables will be copied and stored in new database while creating
If it corrupted Sql server will not start

MSDB
MSDB is an optional Database
It is used for automation like scheduling jobs, alerts
It will store all the data about jobs and alerts etc..
If it is corrupt Sql server will start/run
ssis packages information will be stored in Sql server
Log shipping,Backups and Restores info will be stored in MSDB

TempDB
All the users will store the data in TempDB for temporary
It is better to maintain separate drive for TempDB
We can not take Backup of TempDb
Temporary tables will stored in Tempdb
#temp table  local template
## temp table global template
Table variable, cursors, work tables, row versioning, Indexes etc will be stored
temp DB
when sql server restarts new temp DB will create
If tempdb is corrupted is sql server will be down
Index rebuild or sorting of data will be done in TempDB

Resource Database
Resoure Database will store all the sys objects physically
Before sql server 2005 There is no resource DB
In sql server 2005 we can find Resource db files in Data folder of sql instance
From sql server 2008 we can find resource DB files in root directory Binn folder
Resource Dtabase is hidden DB

Database Ids
Master		1
TempDB		2
Model		3
MSDB		4
ResourceDB	32767

If we start the sql server first system databases will start in the following order
master
Resource Database
model
tempdb
msdb
user databases

Stored procedure to see the details of Databses
SP_HELPDB

sample databases
sql server 2000		pubs, northwind
sql server 2005		Adventureworks
sql server 2016		?

Databases
File groups

Datbase objects and files can be grouped toghether into filegroups for allocation and administration purpose

File group is a collection of Data files
Every database will support 32767 file groups
When we create database primary file group will automatically create
so we can create almost 32766 fie groups
Primary file group will contain data files(mdf, ndf)

When data file is full then error 1105 will come
when log file is full then error 9002 will come.

Trasactions 2 types
Implict transactions
explict transactions

Implicit Transactions
No need to give the starting and ending statements, sql os itself will give those commands as below

Begin tran
commit

Explicit Transactions
we have to explicitly give the BeginTran and commit statements.
We can roll back the explictit transactions where as we can not do this in Implicit transactions

Internals of Sql server
Page:
Minimum block/Unit of storage. The fundamental unit of data storage in sql server is Page. Page size by default 8KB(8192 Bytes)
In a page 8KB 8192 Bytes
Page header will occupy 	96 Bytes
Row offset will occupy 	36 Bytes
		Total	132Bytes
8192-132=8060 Bytes
So we can save 8060 Bytes of data in every page
page can not be shared for multiple tables

SQL Server databases have 128 pages per megabyte. Each page begins with a 96-byte header that is used to store system information about the page. This information includes the page number, page type, the amount of free space on the page, and the allocation unit ID of the object that owns the page.

LOP	Large object page
If the actual row does not fit inside the page, then the biggest variable length column is chosen to be placed in an allocation unit called Row-Overflow-Data(LOP) with 24 byte pointer maintend in the acutal page. if the size of the row shrinks or is truncated then sql server engine will automatically place the column Row over flow data of large object page and places it in the actual page or alternate page based on space availability

Capacity of large object page is 2GB

 
We can not resize the page
Extent:Extent is the collection of 8 continoues pages 
Size of an extent: 8*8=  64KB

Extents
Minimum allocation unit in sql server is extent
Extents are the basic unit in which space is managed
Extent is a 8 continoues data pages
Extent size 64KB (8*8)
1 MB contains 16 Extents

2 Types of extents
Uniform Extent
Mixed Extent

Uniform Extent
Uniform Extents are owned by a single object. all 8 pages in the extent can only be used by the owning object

Mixed Extent
Mixed extents are shared by multiple objects. Each of the eight pages in the extent can be shared by different object.

when we create any new table sql server will allocate mixed extent. why because if the object is small sql server will not going to allocate a full extent for small objects. so ultimately mixed extent will be allocated.

8 Types of pages
1. Datapage
2. Index page
3. Text/Image 
4. GAM/SGAM(Global allocation Map/Shared Global allocation Map)
5. PFS(page free space)
6. IAM (Index allocation Map)
7. BCM(Bulk Changed Map)
8. DCM (Differential Changed Map)

Datapage: Data page will store the data except text, ntext, image, nvarchar(max) varchar(max), varbinary(max) and xml data

Index page: contains information related Indexes

Text/Image page:Large object data types like text, ntext, image nvarchar(max) varchar(max), varbinary(max) and xml data

GAM/SGAM:
Gam(Global Allocation Map) records which extent is free and which extent is allocated. It will track the status of an extents interms of 0 and 1's
Bit 1= Free extent
Bit 0= allocated extent

SGAM: shared Global allocation map : It records which extents are currently used as a mixed extents and have atleaset on unused page or space.If the bit is 1 then extent is used as mixed extent with free page.

PFS (page free space)
It will record the info about page allocation and free space available on pages. It will calculate in percentages. It will track this info for LOP pages
30-50%, 51-80%, 81-95%, 96-100%

Index allocation Map(IAM)
It will tract information about extents used by a table or Index per allocation unit. It will tracks all the tables and in which extent table is present

Bulk changed map(BCM)
Information about all the extents which are modified by the bulk operations
Information about extents modified by bulk operations since the last BACKUP LOG statement per allocation unit.

DCM(differential changed Map)
Info about extents that have changed since the last full backup database statement per allocation using all the changes that we can do to an extent

Page 0 is header
page 1 is pfs(for every 8000 pages 1pfs page will be there)
page 2 is GAM(for every 64000 extents or 4GB of data will be tracked by 1 GAM)
page 3 is SGAM (same as GAM)
page 6 is DCM
page 7 is BCM
page 9 is Boot page

Boot page:
Boot page is one special data page that exists only once per database. It will exist in the mdf file. 9th page of file1 in the primary file group is boot page. It belongs to page type 13. Boot page contains internal db version, compatibility level, DB name, last log backup and last run checkDB info will be there in BOOT PAGE.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Transaction Log file
The transaction log file contains a string (collection) of log records. 
Log files never conains any data, it will contains only transaction, commands, on which table we are executing commands at what time it will executed.
Log file may bigger than data file
Log file contains VLF (virtual log file)
VLF contain log records

Physical Log
The whole space is called physical log. In log at which point log is filled is called Logical Log

Transaction Log file: The sql server database engine divides each physical log file internally a number of virtual log files. Virtual log files have not fixed size, and thre is no fixed number of virtual log files for a physical log file. we can not say the VLF size. DB engine allocated VLF dynamically 
Transaction Log record:
1. LSN (log sequence number)(current lsn, previous LSN)
2. Transaction ID
3. Trasaction statement (command)
4. Time stamp
5. Statement IO(query)
6. Data page details/Object ID
7. Old Image/New Image 
8. COmmited/uncommitted
9. Log record type
10.Redo LSN
11.Completion Record

Like this log file contains 108 attributes.

Min. LSN
The min lsn is the log sequence number of the oldest starting lsn portion of the active log.


VLF(Virtual Log file)
Log file contains VLFs
We can not tell the size of VLf, at the same we can not tell the size of log record.It depends on the no. of transactions.
When we create a DB how many VLFs will be created?

DBCC loginfo
In the table if the status columin is 2 the VLF is active, 
if it is 0 VLF is inactive
In the table FileID 2 means it is a log file.

The formula for creating no.of VLF
if the log file size is(sql server <=2012)
less than or equal to 1MB then it is going to create 2VLF with 1/2 of growth size
>1MBto <=64 MB it is going to create 4 new VLFs of each size 1/4
>64MB to <=1GB then 8 VLF of 1/8th each size 
>1GB , then 16new vlfs of 1/16th of each size

for sql server 2014  
If the growth size of the log file is lessthan 1/8th of the current log size
if yes: create 1 new VLF equal the growth size
If no: it will follow the above formula(sql server <=2012 formula)

LogBlock
The unit of IO for the transaction log is log block. VLFs are split internally into dynamically sized log blocks ranging from 512 bytes to 60KB in 512 bytes increment or intervals.


Instance Aware Services:

    The Instance Aware Services are specific to particular instance of SQL Server.
    If we installed multiple instances you will get multiple copies of aware services.

The following services are:

    SQL Server
    SQL Server Agent.
    SQL Server Analysis Services.
    SQL Server Reporting Services.
    Full- text Service.

Instance Unaware Services:

    The Instance Unaware services are shared among all installed SQL Server instances.

The following services are:

    Integration Services.
    SQL Server Browser Service.
    SQL Writer.
    SQL Server Active Directory Helper.


Un attended Installations
Command based or silent Installation

two types of unattended installations
SQL2K5  SQL2K8
/qb 	/QS	 It will show the screen
/qn  	/Q	it will run in the backgrond

sql server 2005 Installation through unattended
attach the software
open command prompt in run as admin mode
goto setup file of sql server in command prompt
copy paste command from notepad or type the command, make sure the command is in single line if you copy it from notepad
sample final command for sql server 2005 Installation

**no need to install shared tools if you have already installed.If you try to install it will through the error, so the Add_Local=SQL_Engine, no need to mention any other components


INI Based Installation.
It is same as Unattended installation.
We will write query in a note pad and remove slashes and save the notepad as .ini
Then attach the media, open the command prompt as run as admin
goto setup file locaion in command prompt and call the ini file to install sql server

Service Packs
service pack is an yearly update to fix the bugs in the sql server software
To fix the compatibility Issues.

Hot fix is an quick update to fix the live bugs

Cummulative updates
QFE	Quick fix engineering
GDR	General distribution releases

Patch Tuesday:Microsoft will release all the updates in 2nd and 4th Tuesday

you can check the server version by using the below query
select @@version

two types of hot fixes are there 
QFE 	Quick fix engineering
GDR	General distribution release

sql server 2005 	sp1, sp2, sp3,sp4
sql server 2008 	sp1, sp2, sp3,sp4
sql server 8R2	sp1, sp2, sp3
sql server 2012	sp1, sp2, sp3,sp4
sql server 2014	sp1, sp2,sp3
Sql server 2016	sp1,sp2


Precautions to be taken while patching the production server
find the application owner.
take the proper down time from him
raise a change request
discuss the change request in CAB (change authority Board) meeting
then take the approval from CAB
then start the patching as per schedule.

Precautions: Before and After Patching 
1.  Check how many sql servers are running in that machine
2. How many services are up and running
3. Make sure you have a proper free space in the C drive (atleast 3GB)
4. Connect to the sql server and check all the databases status
5. Check sql instance name and make sure object explorer name and query results are same
6. Check the build no.s before and after patching and make sure they are same
7. REboot the server once
8. Take the backu of all the Databases
9. Windows team to take the vm shapshot ~20min.s 
10. Check the whether the machine is VM or PM


Patching sql server in Unattended mode
open command prompt in admin mode
goto to the path of the service pack in the command promt
then execute below command

for a particular instance(up to sql server 2008)
servicepack.exe /qs /action= patch  /Instancename="name of the instace"

for all instances (from sql server 2008R2)
servicepack.exe /qs /action= patch  /allInstances

for a particular instance(up to sql server 2008)
servicepack.exe /qs /action= patch  /Instancename=name of the instace /Iacceptsqlserverlicenseterms

for all instances (From sql server 2008R2)
servicepack.exe /qs /action= patch  /allInstances /Iacceptsqlserverlicenseterms

Uninstalling sql server
we can uninstall sql server in 2 ways
through gui
through cmd

through gui
open appwiz.cpl to open programs and features uninstallation panel
select sql server main service like microsoft sql server 2008(64 bit) click uninstall
then uninstallation window will open the next, next, select the instance that you want to uninstall from the drop down list
then next, next, uninstall

command prompt
open cmd prompt in run as admin mode
goto particular sql server media setup file location. then execute the below command
D:\> setup.exe /action=uninstall /qs /features=sql,as,rs,IS,Tools /Instancename=name of the Instances separated by , and space
example
D:\>setup.exe /QS /Action=Uninstall /FEATURES=SQL,AS,RS,IS,Tools /INSTANCENAME=MSSQLSERVER, YERNIINI, YERNIINSTANCE



slip stream Installation
simple slip stream
attach the sql server media to the d drive
create a folder in c drive and copy the sp(no need to extract, you can directly copy the sp) into newely created folder
open cmd prompt in run as admin mode
goto setup.exe file locaiton in command prompt
then execute the below command
Upto sql server  2008R2
D:\> setup.exe /action=install /pcusource=path of the service pack (Extract the service pack before proceeding with this query)

Example 
D:\> setup.exe /action=install /pcusource=C:\SP\SP Foldername

from sql server 2012
D:\> setup.exe /action=install /updatenabled=true /updatesource=path of the service pack(just folder name that containg sp)

advanced slip stream
First copy the media in to the local computer or server
create a folder in media setup.exe file location
Copy the extracted service pack into that newly created folder
open x64 folder in the media 
open defaultsetup.ini file and enter the below command at the end of the script
up to sql server 2008R2
pcusource=".\servicepack folder name" 

from sql server 2012
updatesource=".\servicepack folder name"

now open setup.exe in the RTM media and continue the installation process.
please check the final screen to confirm whether it is a slipstream installation or not.
in the final screen you can see action:Install(slipstream)


Sysprep
sysprep is not thre in sql server 2005, 2008

Sysprep is a feature from 2008R2

sysprep is an installaiton method in which the process splits in to two phases
1. Prepararion Phase .. prepare Image
Windows team will help to prepare the image where they will copy binaries

2. completion Phase.. complete Image

We have a drawback in Sysprep installation. We can not install sql server using sysprep if already exhisting sql servers are there in that particular Windows server

Skiping the Restart Required Check
Open regedit in Run
Expand--> HkeyLocalMachine--> Expand System --> Expand CurrentControlSet-->Expand Control--> Expand session Manager
Then you can see "pending file rename operations" Right click on the key and click on Modify Binary Data then delete all the data, then close the key
after that rerun the checklist in setup window
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Installation Failures and troubleshooting 
Step1: Goto Binaries folder(C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\110\Setup Bootstrap\Log) and open the summary.txt notepad.
In the summary file check with exit code at the begining of the file, If the exit is 0, sql server successfully installed, if is other than 0 then installation is failed
After that you can see multiple time stamp folders in the same log folder, if you are unable to find the error in earlier summary.txt file then open recent time stamp folder
and check the summary.txt, and Detailed landing page

how to identify error in summary file
open the summary file and serach for "return value 3"

If you did not find any error in the summary file then check the error in event viewer
Shortcut open Run, eventvwr-->windows Logs-->application

If no error found in EverntViewer
Then Open Run, Type %Tmp% then you can see Sqlsetup, Sqlsetup_Local open those files and check for the errors
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
security
Authentication
Authentication is the process of verifying when you are connecting to sql server with username and password successfully

Authorization
Authorization is the process of verifying that you have access on some on objects of sql server

Principles and securables

Principles:Pricipals are the entities which will used to request the resources.

securables:The resources reqeusted by principals are called securables.

A login never enters into database. some representatives will be there to login called user
A login can have 32,767 users

Logins are endpoints to connect to database
login will have 1 user per database
1 user can have 1 login

Every login by default can access master db
Normally we don't prefer single user mapping.. we only prefer group mapping

What are the default logins when we install sql server
sa login
service account login
NT service Instance name
login which we gave during installation

Default Server Roles
BD2PS4
Bulk Admin
DB creator
Disk admin
Process Admin
Security Admin
Server admin
Sys Admin
Setup Admin

Bulk Admin:Members of this group can perform Bulk insert operations on all the databases
DB Creator: Members of this group can create/Alter/Restore/Drop Databases
Disk Admin:Members of this group can manage backup devices.
ProcessAdmin:Memebrs of this group can manage and terminate the procesees of the sql server
Server Admin: Members of this group can change the configuration setting and can shutdown the sql server
Setup Admin:Members of this group acan add/Remove the linked servers
Security Admin: Members of this group can manage security like managing or creating Logins, deleting logings, changing Passwords other logins4
sysadmin:Sysadmin can handle all the permissions

Bulk Admin Example
open note pad copy paste some values or enter data and save the note pad as name.csv
grant Bulkadmin permissions to login
Login with login name
execute the below query
Bulk Insert tablename from 'c:\location of the file\filename.csv'
with
(
FieldTerminator=',' , 
RowTerminator="\n"
)
go

Bulk Insert csvtest from 'C:\Users\jagadish\Desktop\load1.csv'
with
( 
fieldterminator=' , ' ,
rowterminator='\n'
)
go

Default users
Information_Schema
dbo
guest
sys

To find out the permissions of a fixed server role
sp_srvrolepermission serverrolename

To add a memeber in to the server role
Sp_addsrvrolemember loginnamethatyouwant to add, serverrolename
ex
sp_addsrvrolemember kumar, bulkadmin

By default a new login who is not a member of any fixedserver role will have CONNECT SQL permission

Creating user defined server roles
We can create customized server roles from sql server 2012 onwards

If we gave sys admin and deny permissions on a single login sys admin permission will only work

Other than sys admin if we have two permission that inculde deny, then deny will work

to see the logins information in detailed

How to start/Stop Sql server
By using ssms we can start/stop the sql server
Through Configuration manager we can start/stop the sql server
Thourgh services.msc
Thorugh Command we can start/stop sql server
commands
Default Instance
net stop mssqlserver
net start mssqlserver
or1
net start "SQL Server ( instancename )"

Named Instance
net stop mssql$instancename
net start mssql$instancename
or
net start "SQL Server ( instancename )"

Using T-Sql
shutdown

Using PowerShell
Same as cmd commands
net stop....


How to change Instance Name
we have two Instances
Default Instance
Named Instance
CHANGING DEFAULT INSTANCE NAME
FIRST CHECK THE SERVER
NAME OR INSTANC NAME BY USING
SELECT @@SERVERNAME
SP_DROPSERVER SERVERNAME
SP_ADDSERVER SERVERNAME, LOCAL
EXAMPLE
SP_DROPSERVER "WIN-8MDG9204KI"
SP_ADDSERVER "VENKAT",Local

FOR NAMED INSTANCE
WE CAN'T CHANGE NAMED INSTANCE NAME..
WE HAVE TO REINSTALL SQL SERVER WITH NEW NAME AND NEED TO RESTORE ALL THE DATABASES AND LOGINS AND CREDENTIALS FROM THE OLD SERVER

FIXING ORPHON USERS
==================
FIRST CHECK HOW MANY ORPHAN USERS ARE THERE BY USING BELOW QUERY

USE DATABASE NAME
SP_CHANGE_USERS_LOGIN 'REPORT'

1ST METHOD
=========
CREATE LOGIN WITH SAME USER SID
CREATE LOGIN LOGINNAME WITH PASSWORD='PASSWORD', SID=COPY OF THE USER SID, CHECK_EXPIRATION=OFF, CHECK_POLICY=OFF
Drawbacks
Login name should be same as username
we can fix only one orphan user at a time

EXAMPLE
USE [master]
GO
CREATE LOGIN [login20] WITH PASSWORD=N'123', SID=0xED4AC7E6F1E1664CB0DE0A2F23232FDE,CHECK_EXPIRATION=OFF, CHECK_POLICY=OFF
GO


2ND METHOD
===========
Update_One is the most famous method.
First create a login with same name or different name
Update_One can be mapped even if login name and username is same or different
Example
USE ABC;  
GO  
EXEC sp_change_users_login 'Update_One', 'LOGIN21', 'LOGIN23';  
GO  

USE ABC;  
GO  
EXEC sp_change_users_login 'Update_One', 'username', 'loginname';  
GO  

But for this method first we
need to create a login. It can be same or different name when compared to username. In this case we are updating the sid of user. Drawback is we can update only one user at a time and we have to create the logins for all orphan users before fixing it up.

Another method to fix the orphsn users is
Auto_fix
Auto_fix  can be used even without creating the login.
Command
use databasename
go
sp_change_users_login Auto_fix, 'username', NULL, 'Password of new login'
Example
GO  
EXEC sp_change_users_login 'Auto_Fix', 'Login23', NULL, 'Dbaclasses123';  
GO  
Here a login will create with same username. In this case login sid will be changed. This command will work  for Sql Logins not for windows logins.

Real time method to fix the Orphan Users
===============================
Sp_helprevlogin
 
Fixing Windows Logins
If windows login deleted(not windows user) then we have to create that windows login automatically the windows orphan users will be fixed.
Select *from sys.syslogins where name like '%windows username%'

to check the windows login orphan users query?

Fixing Windows Orphan logins
=======================
Orphan Logins
If windows users in the windows level has been deleted then that particular logins are called windows orpahn logins or orphan logins.
we can see orphan logins by using 
sp_validatelogins
But unfortunatley we can't fix the orphan logins. We have to create new windwos user at windows level and create new windows login in sql server. delete the existing or old windows login.But before deleting script all the logins

==================================
Default Users in Databases
====================
1.dbo
2.guest
3.Information_schema
4.sys

dbo
-------
The dbo is a user that has implied permissions to perform all activities in the database. Any member of the sysadmin fixed server role who uses a database is mapped to the special user inside each database called dbo.The dbo user cannot be deleted and is always present in every database.

Guest:
--------
Guest user is a default user present in all the databases which is disabled. Except in master, msdb, tempdb.
If guest is enabled everyone can access that database with basic permissions
By default, guest user exists in all user and system databases. Having guest user enabled inside databases, leaves a security risks of unauthorized (or unaudited) access to the data because Guest user allows database access to logins who do not have associated users inside SQL Server databases. By disabling guest user access from the user databases will ensure, that member of PUBLIC server role may not be able to access user databases on SQL Server instance, unless they have access to the database explicitly.

Information_Schema
===============
container having metadata about the objects with in a databse. common for all rdbms softwares. If this is enabled then everyone from different rdbms softwares like oracle, db2, sysbase, can see sql server objects

sys user:
-----------
contains metadata about the database and all objects (as per sqlserver standards)
sys has own schema called sys schema

contain database
=============
Contain database is a new feature from 2012.
If the containment type of a database is none then is is called normal database.
If the containment type is partial then it is contain database.
For this option first you have to enab le "enable contain database" option in the server level by making it true.
You can find this option in the advanced page of server properties.
