Sql Server error log
EventViewer
Check the Sql Services are up and running
Whether databases are up and running or not
What is the PORT

sp_who2

Check Sql server Error Log

Check all the processes using sp_who2 or select *from sys.sysprocesses
check all processes from spid>50, check login, command and Blockings
Blocking are very important.. if any blocking are there then they are going to kill the performance
Find the blocking processes
and  check who is running the processes
then contact him using communicator tool
ask him what query he is running
will ask him 

Check any jobs are running and check since what time jobs are running check the duration of that job last time when it ran from job history -- using Job Activity monitor

backup job,
check db job
dbcc update statistics
Indexing job

Check max server memory and min. server memory
Give 80-90% to sql server if only sql server is running in the machine
If any RS and AS are running give 50-60% to sql server and 30% to RS or AS

Check all cpus are selected from processors tab in sql server properties.

Check index fill factor in Database settings of Sql server properties-- make sure it is 80% is there

check Cost Threshold parallesm and Max DOP values from Advanced tab in Server properties
usually Cost Threshold parallesm will be in a range of 4 to 5
The Max Degree of Parallelism(MDop) simply defines the number of processors\cores that SQL Server will use when the optimizer determines parallelism is needed.  
The best value is no. of cores but not exceeded more than 8

Will Check Rebuild, Reorg Indexing and Update statistics Jobs
If the jobs are failed or cancelled I will rerun it by taking proper apporvals



The Compatibility level of the database



TempDB

Keeping Temp DB data files and log files in a separate is recommanded.

Add the data files based the logical processors to the Temp DB
if 2 logical processors are there 2 data files should be there for Temp DB

DBCC freeprocache
DBCC freesystemcache
DBCC Dropcleanbuffers
DBCC freesessioncache
Checkpoint

Health Checks

check the sql server error log
check the status of all the databases
check the sql services running or not
whether all mentioned jobs are succeeded or not
Check the event viewer
Check the Drives whether all drives is having enough free space or not
check CPU and memory usage
